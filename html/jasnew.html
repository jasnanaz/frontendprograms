                    Kerala does not have incessant rains that stop all activity. 
                    It rains for a few hours with sunny interludes. Occasionally 
                    the rains might stretch on for a few days but sunshine is never 
                    far away.
                    Kerala has mainly two rainy seasons. The Southwest Monsoon that arrives 
                    in the month of June is called Edavappathy, as it comes in the middle of

                 According to Ayurveda, Monsoon is the best season for rejuvenation therapies. 
                 During the Monsoon season, the atmosphere remains dust-free and cool.</p>
